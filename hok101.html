    <h1>Getting Started: A Beginner's Guide to Honor of Kings</h1>
    
    <p>Honor of Kings is an exciting and strategic MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) game where two teams of five heroes compete to destroy each other's base. If you're new to the game, this guide will introduce you to the fundamentals, including hero roles, map layout, objectives, and basic controls. Let's dive in and help you get started on your journey to mastering the game.</p>

    <h2>1. Understanding the Basics of Honor of Kings</h2>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The primary goal of Honor of Kings is to destroy the enemy's Core Crystal at the heart of their base. To achieve this, you'll need to defeat enemies, destroy turrets, and work as a team.</p>
    <p><strong>Game Format:</strong> Matches are played in a 5v5 format on a three-lane map. Each team defends their side of the map while pushing forward to attack the enemy's base.</p>

    <h2>2. The Map Layout</h2>
    <p>The Honor of Kings map is split into three main areas:</p>

    <h3>Three Lanes</h3>
    <p>These are the paths where the action happens. Minions spawn and march down these lanes to help you destroy enemy turrets.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Top Lane:</strong> Typically played by fighters or tanks.</li>
      <li><strong>Mid Lane:</strong> Controlled by mages due to its central position and quick rotations.</li>
      <li><strong>Bottom Lane:</strong> Farm lane for marksmen, often accompanied by a support (roamer).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Jungle</h3>
    <p>The areas between the lanes filled with neutral monsters. The Jungler farms these monsters to gain gold, experience, and powerful buffs.</p>

    <h3>Turrets and Objectives</h3>
    <p><strong>Turrets:</strong> Structures that defend the lanes. Your team must destroy enemy turrets to progress toward their Core Crystal.</p>
    <p><strong>Objectives:</strong> Key neutral monsters appear in the jungle:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Overlord:</strong> Grants your team a powerful buff and pushes lanes.</li>
      <li><strong>Dark Slayer:</strong> Provides a team-wide stat boost.</li>
      <li><strong>Buff Monsters:</strong> Red and blue buffs that provide bonus effects to heroes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Hero Roles and How They Work</h2>
    <p>Heroes in Honor of Kings are divided into 5 main roles, each serving a unique purpose on the team:</p>

    <h3>1. Clash (Fighter/Bruiser)</h3>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Strong and durable heroes who excel in close combat. They dominate the Top Lane.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Lu Bu, Arthur.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Focus on balancing damage and defense to win duels and sustain longer fights.</p>

    <h3>2. Roamer (Tank/Support)</h3>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Protect allies, initiate fights, and provide vision and crowd control (CC).</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Zhang Fei, Donghuang Taiyi.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Stick with your marksman early and rotate to help teammates across the map.</p>

    <h3>3. Jungler (Assassin/Fighter)</h3>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Farm the jungle, secure objectives, and gank lanes to create pressure.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Han Xin, Li Bai.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always secure buff monsters and rotate efficiently to surprise the enemy.</p>

    <h3>4. Mid Lane (Mage)</h3>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Deal burst magical damage and control the central lane.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Mozi, Angela.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use your spells to clear waves quickly and roam to help other lanes.</p>

    <h3>5. Farm Lane (Marksman)</h3>
    <p><strong>Role:</strong> Focus on farming gold and dealing sustained damage in team fights.</p>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Marco Polo, Luban No.7.</p>
    <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Position carefully behind tanks or supports to deal consistent damage.</p>

    <h2>4. Controls and Gameplay Mechanics</h2>
    <p>Mastering the controls is key to playing effectively:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Left Joystick:</strong> Use this to control your hero's movement.</li>
      <li><strong>Right Buttons:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Basic Attack Button: For regular attacks.</li>
          <li>Skill Buttons: Use hero abilities. Every hero has 3 active skills and 1 passive skill.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Mini-Map:</strong> Use this to monitor your allies, enemies, and objectives.</li>
      <li><strong>Recall:</strong> Return to the base to heal and shop for items.</li>
      <li><strong>Skill Upgrades:</strong> Level up your abilities as you gain experience during the match.</li>
    </ul>
